# Historical history dissertations, data and analysis

ProQuest provided me with two dumps of the *Dissertations and Theses*
database: one has all the dissertations in all fields since 2000; the
other has all dissertations in history and cognate fields since the
beginning of time (in practice, since the 1870s). By the terms of my
agreement with ProQuest, I can't share the data.

This repository contains code to munge the data and to analyze it. I'm
writing up the results on [my blog][]. Perhaps someday it will become
something more formal than that.
